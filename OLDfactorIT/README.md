# TrackIT Inventory App

**Note:** The new refactored project is being scaffolded in a separate directory called `refactored_trackit` to ensure a clear separation from the legacy codebase. All new development and refactoring will occur in this directory, while the existing code remains unchanged for reference and migration purposes.
