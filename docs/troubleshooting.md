# Troubleshooting

This guide provides solutions to common issues you might encounter while using the Inventory Tracking System.

## Application Not Loading

### Symptoms
- Blank screen
- Error messages in the browser console
- Application freezes during loading

### Possible Causes and Solutions

#### Missing Dependencies
**Cause**: Required packages are not installed or have version conflicts.
**Solution**: 
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

#### Browser Compatibility
**Cause**: Using an outdated or unsupported browser.
**Solution**: Update your browser to the latest version or try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).

#### JavaScript Disabled
**Cause**: JavaScript is disabled in your browser.
**Solution**: Enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

## Data Not Saving

### Symptoms
- Changes to inventory items or settings don't persist after page refresh
- Error messages when trying to save data

### Possible Causes and Solutions

#### localStorage Issues
**Cause**: Browser localStorage is full or disabled.
**Solution**: 
1. Clear some space in localStorage by removing unused data from other sites
2. Check browser settings to ensure localStorage is enabled
3. Try using a different browser

#### Private Browsing Mode
**Cause**: Using private/incognito browsing mode, which limits localStorage.
**Solution**: Use regular browsing mode instead of private/incognito mode.

## Form Submission Problems

### Symptoms
- Cannot submit forms
- Form validation errors that don't make sense
- Form submits but data doesn't appear

### Possible Causes and Solutions

#### Validation Errors
**Cause**: Input data doesn't meet validation requirements.
**Solution**: Check the error messages and adjust your input accordingly.

#### Combobox Component Issues
**Cause**: The Combobox component used in forms is not properly implemented.
**Solution**: This is a known issue being addressed in the next update. As a workaround, try using the basic form fields and avoid custom dropdowns.

## Barcode Scanner Not Working

### Symptoms
- Camera doesn't activate
- Camera activates but doesn't recognize barcodes
- Error messages when trying to scan

### Possible Causes and Solutions

#### Camera Permissions
**Cause**: Browser doesn't have permission to access the camera.
**Solution**: When prompted, allow the browser to access your camera. If you previously denied permission, you'll need to reset it in your browser settings.

#### Unsupported Browser
**Cause**: Using a browser that doesn't support the MediaDevices API.
**Solution**: Use a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.

#### Poor Lighting or Focus
**Cause**: The barcode is not visible to the camera due to lighting or focus issues.
**Solution**: Ensure good lighting, hold the barcode steady, and position it within the scanning frame.

## Export Functionality Issues

### Symptoms
- Export button doesn't work
- Downloaded file is corrupted or empty
- Error messages when trying to export

### Possible Causes and Solutions

#### No Data to Export
**Cause**: Trying to export an empty dataset.
**Solution**: Ensure there is data to export before clicking the export button.

#### File Download Blocked
**Cause**: Browser is blocking file downloads.
**Solution**: Check browser settings to allow downloads from the application.

## Performance Issues

### Symptoms
- Application runs slowly
- UI feels unresponsive
- Long loading times

### Possible Causes and Solutions

#### Large Dataset
**Cause**: Managing a very large inventory dataset in localStorage.
**Solution**: Consider exporting and archiving older data to reduce the size of the active dataset.

#### Browser Resources
**Cause**: Limited browser resources or many open tabs.
**Solution**: Close unnecessary tabs and applications to free up resources.

## Specific Error Messages

### "Failed to resolve import from..."
**Cause**: Missing or incorrectly referenced dependencies.
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and imported.

### "Cannot read properties of undefined..."
**Cause**: Trying to access properties of an object that doesn't exist.
**Solution**: Check that the data you're trying to access is properly loaded before accessing its properties.

### "localStorage is not defined"
**Cause**: Running the application in an environment where localStorage is not available.
**Solution**: Ensure you're running the application in a web browser with localStorage support.
