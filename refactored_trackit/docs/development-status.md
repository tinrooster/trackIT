## Recent Major Fixes

### Stack Overflow Issue in Settings Components
We successfully resolved the "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors occurring in the settings components with a comprehensive architecture redesign:

1. **Root Causes**:
   - Circular dependencies between modules
   - Recursive API calls in React components
   - Improper error handling causing cascading failures
   - Repeated connection checks leading to API call cascades

2. **Solution**:
   - Created a static store for application state (`staticStore.ts`)
   - Implemented an operation queue with circuit breaker pattern (`operationQueue.ts`)
   - Built a safe storage service with deferred backend synchronization (`safeStorageService.ts`)
   - Completely rewrote settings components to use the new architecture
   - Decoupled UI rendering from backend operations
   - Added proper timeouts and retry mechanisms
   - Implemented offline mode with localStorage fallback

3. **Benefits**:
   - Immediate UI rendering with cached data
   - Resilient backend communication with proper retry logic
   - Graceful degradation in offline or error scenarios
   - Better performance through decoupled architecture
   - Improved error handling with useful error messages

## Next Steps

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| HIGH | Complete Asset Management | IN PROGRESS | Applying the new architecture pattern |
| HIGH | Unit testing suite | PLANNED | Focus on critical services first |
| MEDIUM | User Management | PLANNED | Will follow same architectural patterns |
| MEDIUM | Reporting UI | PLANNED | Need design specs |
| LOW | Mobile optimization | PLANNED | After core functionality complete |
